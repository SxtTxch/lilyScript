# lilyScript
## Introduction
Author: sxttxch  
lilyScript is made on python, hence it's speed is slower than python.  
lilyScript is done as a fun little project by me and it's not recommended to use it (if anybody would want to use it).  
One of the main reasons I started this project is to first of all:  
-expand my own knowledge and experience  
-have a shot at creating a language that is far more easily understandable by people than other ones.  
-To give you the free will of toying with this 'sandbox'. You can edit the source code and add other modules to increase the capability of lilyScript.  
The project has officialy started as of 21.05.2023 (as now the foundation is done and the languages capabilities can be easily expanded).  
Please report any bugs to sxttxch#6296 on discord.  
## How do I start?

### Installation
1. Download this repository and put it into your desired directory.  
2. You need python for this language so download python from: [https://www.python.org](https://www.python.org)  
3. Run your first ever lilyScript module by running the main.py file!  
## How do I write code in lilyScript?
lilyScript is a language that offers module oriented programming, infact the installation process, just downloads a lilyScript module.  
1. lilyScript looks for index.lilyS, please name your script that so as to make lily faster!  
2. Get familiar with lilies documentation: STILL IN PROGRESS: [Click here!](https://d9026e21-8e42-48b0-a939-f808deb07da9.mynotice.io/)
3. If you aren't new to programming just check out the interpreter!
