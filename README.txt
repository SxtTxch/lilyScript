# lilyScript
Author: sxttxch
lilyScript is made on python, hence it's speed is slower than python.
lilyScript is done as a fun little project by me and it's not recommended to use it (if anybody would want to use it).
One of the main reasons I started this project is to first of all:
-expand my own knowledge and experience
-have a shot at creating a language that is far more easily understandable by people than other ones.
-To give you the free will of toying with this 'sandbox'. You can edit the source code and add other modules to increase the capability of lilyScript.
The project has officialy started as of 21.05.2023 (as now the foundation is done and the languages capabilities can be easily expanded).
